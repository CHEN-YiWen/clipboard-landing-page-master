## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

- Overall, I think this challenge isn't too difficult. I used <code>display: flex</code> to create similar layout as the design. 
- The part that took me some time was placing the computer image in the desktop design. At first, I tried to use <code>position: absolute</code> and <code>position: relative</code>. However, I found it was way easier to simply set margin in minus.


### Continued development
- I would like to try styling the whole page again with <code>display: grid</code>
- When I resize the viewport for the desktop design, the internal links in the footer will trun into three rows instead of two. I still need to figure how to make it stick to two rows.
